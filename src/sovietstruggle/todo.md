# Possible Ideas
- Use internal frame for popups (rename/move army, intro text)
- Make it so certain conditions need to be correct for a decision to be taken
- Represent faction's armies with corresponding faction's color on caps
- Add and implement split button

# Todo
- Print out battle ongoings and results in Battle Log
- Make AI actually do things
- Make it so armies can only move/attack successfully once
- Setup so relevant image files are copied to an objective folder
- Make it so you cannot end turn with two armies in one area

# Done
- Add army in Upper North Caucasus as well as implementing correct border areas
- Add info option in drop-down menu for allied and enemy armies
