The year is 1917. V.I. Lenin and the Bolsheviks have begun the long-foretold
dictatorship of the proletariat!

Unfortunately, not everyone stands with the new world... The
Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine, an army led by Admiral Kolchak in
Siberia, and the rest of the White forces under Pyotr Wrangel in Crimea stand as
looming menaces, at every moment threatening to depose the working man and
restore the bourgeoise!
